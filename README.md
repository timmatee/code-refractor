# <Code Refractor>

## Description

Added semantic HTML elements to this webpage so the codebase meets accessibility standards and by doing so it optimizes the site in search engine results.

By recoding the HTML elements using semantic HTML I was able to put different sections of the site into specific parts. A lot of the coding was repeated with the same values so I was able to change the classes to their relevant allocated sections and remove the repeated values.
